## Why Hybrid

First, I've been working with my clients on microservies for several years and 
I feel the pain for Java EE developers to switch to microservice architecture. 
Almost everything they've learned in Java EE is anti-pattern in Microservices
and it is a big paradigm shift. It would be easy for them to move step by step
to fully adopt microservices.


Also, for most companies, pure microservices might not be suitable as the
infrastructure and management overhead is too high initially. For most of
organizations, they are not in a size to adopt microservices before their
application grows to the right size. For startup companies, it is wise to
build something still monolithic but can be split up when the application
grows bigger.
